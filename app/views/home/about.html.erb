      I'm a Web Developer from the Greater Seattle Area.
      After graduating with a Communications degree,I decided I wanted a craft I could call my own.
      A few developers introduced me to programming While I was working in customer service at a tech startup. After completing a few courses from Code Academy,
      I fell in love and knew it was time for me to take the next step.
      Since I had just graduated and was working full time, going back to college for a CS degree would not be possible. A friend of mine told me about Bloc, a coding bootcamp that allows you to choose your learning pace. I enrolled in Blocâ€™s full stack web development bootcamp in July, 2015 and completed it in May, 2016.
      Since then, I have been working at a startup called MediaRails. MediaRails is a CRM application that helps manage affiliate marketing.
